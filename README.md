# MultilevelSidekiq

Capistrano recipe for running multiple processes with multiple configurations.
When running multiple sidekiq processes, it loads different configuration file
for each process if available. The configuration files should be named as:

    sidekiq.yml, sidekiq.yml-1, sidekiq.yml-2, ...

Use case for this would be running multiple sidekiq processes watching
different queues. For example, some may have `:heavy` queue for long-running
background jobs (like batch processing) and `:default` queue for other
purposes. If you let processes to watch multiple queues simultaneously, it may
cause denial of service problem as long-running jobs would eat all the child
threads eventually.
